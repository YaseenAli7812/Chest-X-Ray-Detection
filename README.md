**Overview**

This project focuses on detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using a deep learning approach. The model leverages Transfer Learning with the VGG16 architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), to classify X-ray images into two categories: Normal and Pneumonia. The goal is to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more accurately and efficiently.

**Introduction**

Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs, causing symptoms like cough, fever, and difficulty breathing. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to automate the detection of pneumonia using chest X-ray images by training a deep learning model based on the VGG16 architecture.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, which contains X-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia. The dataset is divided into two main categories:

Normal: X-ray images of healthy lungs.

Pneumonia: X-ray images of lungs infected with pneumonia.

The dataset is further split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

**Methodology**

Data Preprocessing: The X-ray images are resized to a uniform dimension (150x150 pixels) and normalized to ensure consistency in the input data.

Transfer Learning: The VGG16 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, is used as the base model. The final layers of VGG16 are replaced with custom layers to adapt the model for binary classification (Normal vs. Pneumonia).

Model Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed X-ray images. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zooming, and flipping are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.

**Model Architecture**

The model architecture is based on the VGG16 network, with the following modifications:

Base Model: VGG16 (pre-trained on ImageNet) with the top layers removed.

**Custom Layers:**

Global Average Pooling Layer

Fully Connected Layer (Dense) with 512 units and ReLU activation

Dropout Layer (0.5 dropout rate)

Output Layer (Dense) with 1 unit and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

**Results**

The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:

Accuracy: 
         [0.8205]

Precision: 
         [No Pneumonia: 0.99

         Yes Pneumonia: 0.74]

Recall: 
         [No Pneumonia: 0.65

         Yes Pneumonia: 1.00]

F1-Score: 
         [No Pneumonia: 0.78

         Yes Pneumonia: 0.85]

The model demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and pneumonia-infected X-ray images, making it a valuable tool for assisting in the diagnosis of pneumonia.
